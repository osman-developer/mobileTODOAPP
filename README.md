# mobileTODOAPP
Hello, here's a mobile TodoApp developed using ionic ( a crossplatform ) but I don't have a macbook to give you the .ipa for the ios devices, so here's only the .apk for android devices. [android Os 9.0.0]. In this application, I used Angular and SQLITE for the database, it's simple and easy to use.
To open it on your computer, first of all make sure you have nodejs,npm  and ionic installed on your computer.
Second, navigate to the folder in CLI and type npm install (it will install the plugins and packages used) after that type : ionic cordova add android or ios in order to create
a platform.
